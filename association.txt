Association
  - You can also say relation.
  - An association is a business component that defines a 
  relationship between two entity objects based on common 
  attributes.
  - The relationship can be:
    one-to-one,
    one-to-many,
    or many-to-many.
  - The association allows entity objects to access the data 
  of other entity objects through a persistent reference.
  - Sequelize provides four types of associations that should 
    be combined to create them:
      The HasOne association
      The BelongsTo association
      The HasMany association
      The BelongsToMany association
