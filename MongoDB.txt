What is MongoDB?
  - MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that 
    is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows 
    you to work with that data very efficiently.
_______________________________________________________________________________
- The MongoDB database contains collections just like the MYSQL database 
  contains tables. You are allowed to create multiple databases and 
  multiple collections.
- Now inside of the collection we have documents. These documents contain 
  the data we want to store in the MongoDB database and a single collection 
  can contain multiple documents and you are schema-less means it is not 
  necessary that one document is similar to another.
- The documents are created using the fields. Fields are key-value pairs in 
  the documents, it is just like columns in the relation database. The value 
  of the fields can be of any BSON data types like double, string, boolean, 
  etc.
- The data stored in the MongoDB is in the format of BSON documents. Here, 
  BSON stands for Binary representation of JSON documents. Or in other words, 
  in the backend, the MongoDB server converts the JSON data into a binary form 
  that is known as BSON and this BSON is stored and queried more efficiently.
- In MongoDB documents, you are allowed to store nested data. This nesting of 
  data allows you to create complex relations between data and store them in 
  the same document which makes the working and fetching of data extremely 
  efficient as compared to SQL. In SQL, you need to write complex joins to get 
  the data from table 1 and table 2. The maximum size of the BSON document 
  is 16MB.

How mongoDB is different from RDBMS ?
- MongoDB: It is a non-relational and document-oriented database.
  RDBMS: It is a relational database.
- MongoDB: It is suitable for hierarchical data storage.
  RDBMS: It is not suitable for hierarchical data storage.
- MongoDB: It has a dynamic schema.
  RDBMS: It has a predefined schema.
- MongoDB: It centers around the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, 
            and Partition tolerance).
  RDBMS: It centers around ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, 
            Isolation, and Durability).
- MongoDB: In terms of performance, it is much faster than RDBMS.
  RDBMS: In terms of performance, it is slower than MongoDB.

Relations in NoSQL:
- Nested/Embedded document:
        custmers collection:
          {
            userName: "SomeName",
            age: 28,
            address: {
              street: "some Whare",
              cite: "Some City"
            }
          }
- References:
        custmers collection:
          {
            userName: "SomeName"
            favBooks: ["id1", "id2"]
          }

        books collection:
          {
            _id: "id1",
            name: "The Great Gatsby"
          }
